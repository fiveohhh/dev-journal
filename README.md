# Dev Journal

A lightweight application meant to allow developers (or other CLI fans) to
create tagged journal entries or notes that are easily searched/retrievable.

## Usage

### Create a note

~~~Rust
devj add
~~~

## Credits

The inspiration for this was derived from dnote[https://github.com/dnote/dnote].
I loved the idea of dnote, but I wanted to be able to put multiple tags on an note
as well as add attachments (attachments are still a wip).
